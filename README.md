In this project, I am developing an algorithm that detects metastatic cancer in small sections of larger digital pathology images. The dataset used here is an adapted version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset. The dataset contains numerous small pathology images for classification, each named by an image id. The 'train_labels.csv' file contains true labels for images in the 'train' folder, and the goal is to predict labels for the 'test' folder images. A positive label indicates that the center 32x32px region of a patch contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue.
